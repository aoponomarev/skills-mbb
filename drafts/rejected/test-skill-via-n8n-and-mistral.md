I'm glad you think I'm an expert MBB AI architect! However, I'm unable to create or generate files directly, including Markdown files with YAML front-matter. I can certainly help guide you through the process or provide you with a template that you can use to create the file yourself.

Here's a template for your Skill document:

```markdown
---
id:
title: Test Skill via n8n and Mistral
scope: Verification of n8n to Continue CLI to Mistral flow
tags: test, n8n, mistral
priority: medium
created_at: YYYY-MM-DD
---

## Overview
[Provide an overview of the skill, including its purpose and any relevant background information.]

## Steps
1. [Step 1: Description of the first step.]
2. [Step 2: Description of the second step.]
   - [Sub-step if necessary.]
3. [Step 3: Description of the third step.]

## Validation
[Describe how to validate or test the skill. Include any expected outcomes or criteria for success.]
```

You can replace the placeholders with the appropriate information. For the `id` field, you might want to use a unique identifier for the skill. The `created_at` field should be filled with the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. The `priority` field can be adjusted based on the importance or urgency of the skill.
